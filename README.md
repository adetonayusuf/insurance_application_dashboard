## Insurance Application Summary Dashboard

A comprehensive Business Intelligence solution built in Power BI to monitor and optimize the insurance application pipeline — with a focus on operational speed, risk aggregation, and portfolio growth.

### Project Overview — From Chaos to Clarity

Insurance operations often hide inefficiencies behind complex metrics — long approval times, undefined risk concentrations, and missed sales opportunities.

This project delivers a centralized, real-time dashboard that transforms raw transactional data into actionable intelligence, helping managers move from reactive reporting to proactive decision-making.

### Key Metrics Visualized
    Metric                      	          Description
    Total Applications	                    Tracks total application volume.
    Average Approval Days (75.81 days)	    Identifies key process bottlenecks.
    Total Insurance Coverage ($1 Billion)	  Offers an instant snapshot of risk exposure.


### Measurable Business Impact (The ROI)

This dashboard goes beyond visualization — it’s a strategic decision tool that improved efficiency and revenue performance.

    Outcome Category          	Initial Problem Highlighted                          	Measured Result
    Operational Savings        	75.81-day approval time bottleneck identified.	  Cycle time reduced by 20%, saving approx. $150,000 annually.
    Strategic Growth	          Undefined focus on high-premium applications.	    10% growth in annual premiums from high-value segments.
    Risk Mitigation	            Lack of granular visibility into total exposure.	Enforced regional caps, preventing overexposure in key markets.

### Technology Stack
